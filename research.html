              <ul class="main-aboutme">
                <li>In the past, the quality of communication services was evaluated using QoS, which is an index of network performance.
                  However, in recent years, the network status has become unstable due to the increase in the amount of Internet traffic,
                  and it has become difficult to grasp the service quality from the service user's point of view by QoS evaluation.
                  Therefore, QoE, which is an index showing the quality of user experience,
                  is attracting attention as an evaluation index instead of QoS.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>To improve QoE (Quality of Experience) for video streaming ...
              </li>
              <ul class="main-aboutme">
                <li>It is said that the user experience quality (QoE) during video streaming is greatly affected by the three factors of high bit rate, time when video cannot be viewed, and bit rate fluctuation.
                In order to improve QoE, we proposed an adaptive streaming method in which the bit rate is made as large as possible, the video cannot be viewed, and the bit rate fluctuation is suppressed as much as possible.
                Currently, in order to further improve user satisfaction, we are researching a dynamic bandwidth control method that considers user preference.
